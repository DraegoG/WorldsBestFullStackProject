# WorldsBestFullStackProject
This is actually a practice project to learn:
1. Creating a simple website with a frontend in HTML and JS and having a backend in Java-springboot
2. Learn how a jenkins pipeline works - creating docker images for frontend and backned using jenkins pipeline
3. How we can create a jenkins pipeline - to create EC2 instances in an AWS infra using AWS CLI, deploy the docker images in the EC2 setups -> in this way we will be having the website deployed in AWS
